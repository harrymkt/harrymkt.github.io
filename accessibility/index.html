<h1 id="mainc">accessibility</h1>
<p>I use the structure of the site clean and accessible as possible, especially with the visually impaired people. as I am a blind people, I implemented the accessibility of the site to be fully and responsive.</p>
<h2>headings</h2>
<p>you can use headings to navigate around each section. for example, each game is listed on each heading at my projects page.</p>

<h2>unability</h2>
<p>I am unable to process the colour designs for the site, look and appearances are also included. this is because I can't see the colour, look and appearances do to the blindness.</p>
<p>therefore, although I have implemented css styles as possible, the look and appearances may not be accurate in some parts.</p>
