# Accessibility
I use the structure of the site clean and accessible as possible, especially with the visually impaired people. As I am a blind people, I implemented the accessibility of the site to be fully and responsive.

## Headings
You can use Headings to navigate around each section. For example, each game is listed on each Heading at my Projects page.

## Unability
I am unable to process the colour designs for the site, look and appearances are also included. This is because I can't see the colour, look and appearances do to the blindness.

Therefore, although I have implemented CSS styles as possible, the look and appearances may not be accurate in some parts.
