[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Official website") is a static site generator written in Go language optimized for speed and designed for flexibility.
<!--more-->
With its advanced templating system and fast asset pipelines, Hugo renders a complete site in seconds, often less.

Due to its flexible framework, multilingual support, and powerful taxonomy system, Hugo is widely used to create corporate, government, nonprofit, education, news, event, documentation, and project sites, as well as business, professional, and personal blogs

## Features
* Multiplatform; Install Hugo’s single executable on Linux, macOS, Windows, and more.
* Multilingual; Localize your project for each language and region, including translations, images, dates, currencies, numbers, percentages, and collation sequence. Hugo’s multilingual framework supports single-host and multihost configurations.
* Output formats; Render each page of your site to one or more output formats, with granular control by page kind, section, and path. While HTML is the default output format, you can add JSON, RSS, CSV, and more. For example, create a REST API to access content.
* Templates; Create templates using variables, functions, and methods to transform your content, resources, and data into a published page. While HTML templates are the most common, you can create templates for any output format.
* Themes; Reduce development time and cost by using one of the hundreds of themes contributed by the Hugo community. Themes are available for corporate sites, documentation projects, image portfolios, landing pages, personal and professional blogs, resumes, CVs, and more.
* Modules; Reduce development time and cost by creating or importing packaged combinations of archetypes, assets, content, data, templates, translation tables, static files, or configuration settings. A module may serve as the basis for a new site, or to augment an existing site.
* And many more features!

## Notes
Hugo is not simple as [Cobalt]({{% relref "cobalt-about" %}}) and [Zola]({{% relref "zola-about" %}}), but it provides many more features and full multilingual / taxonomy support.
