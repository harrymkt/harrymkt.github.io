Hello everyone. This is the first blog post, and I wanted to share an update on my current situation.
<!--more-->
On August 24, 2024, at around 09:00 PM GMT+06:30 Asia/Yangon standard time, my computer broke down unexpectedly. After a nerve-wracking wait, the root cause was finally discovered three days later on August 27, 2024, at around 06:00 PM GMT+06:30 Asia/Yangon standard time.

It turns out that the hard drive had failed, leaving me with no choice but to purchase a new one. My previous drive was an HDD, so I decided to upgrade to a more reliable SSD. Unfortunately, this means that all the data I had accumulated over time is now lost. Iâ€™ve sent the old disk for possible repairs, but it remains uncertain whether any of the data can be recovered.

This situation has brought a lot of unexpected changes. Sadly, all the games I had been enjoying have come to a complete halt. It's disheartening to think about all the progress and memories that might be gone for good.

But every ending is a new beginning, right? Here's to hoping for better times ahead!

## Updates as of $updated$
Unfortunately, the status of the hard disk recovery was not reported. However, here are some current status:
* [Endless Battle](https://harrymkt.github.io/endless-battle) is being reworked; this means that the game is being redeveloped starting from scratch again, and for backup, I've saved to a private git repository so it will not loss in case of issue.
